refresh on directions page shows empty directions

in directions page, if you get directions, and click on another location, the end destination changes but not the directions

when you leave directions, path still highlighted, even though you cant get back to directions

map is kind of big, maybe margins

travel route is never used

directions page not showing on mobile when a marker is clicked

app.config has commented out code, do we need?

tv guide does not appear to be updating - investigate
